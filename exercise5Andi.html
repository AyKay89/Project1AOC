<h2> Plot </h2>

<p> Jeffrey "the dude" Lebowski's the ultimate Los Angeles slacker. One day, his house is broken into, and his rug is urinated on by 2 angry hired heavies who've mistaken him for another Jeffrey Lebowski, that one's a Los Angeles millionaire, whose wife owes some people big money. The dude becomes entangled in his namesake's problem when he goes to visit the other Lebowski in order to get some recompense for his soiled rug. Instead, he's offered a job for a lot of money; act as liaison between Lebowski and the captors of his now "kidnapped" wife. </p>
