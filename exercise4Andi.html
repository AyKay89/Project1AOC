<h1> Artist: The Milk Carton Kids </h1>

<h2> Song: Michigan </h2>

<p> <span> Milk Carton Kids </span>
<span> Michigan </span> </p>

<p> <div> It's unannounced like you'd expected </div>
<div> Among broke down break lines and Motown records </div>
<div> And all that's left is a blind reflection </div>
<div> But you know what's coming and you regret it </div> </p>
